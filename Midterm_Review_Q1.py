# One of your colleagues has written the following functions.
# Get_Score(user_name)
# which returns a test score for the user student_name.
# and
#
# Get_average(total, number_of_students)
# which returns the average of all the scores.
# They have saved these functions in a file named scores.py.
# Using these two functions, write a function main() that does the following
#
# Assuming that there are 100 students in the class, use For Loop to
# 1.1 Ask user to enter their name
# 1.2 Use the Get_score(user_name)function to get the userâ€™s score
# Calculate the total score
# Calculate the test score average by using the function Get_average(total, number_of_students) function
# Note: You are required to use the two functions that your colleague has written to perform the tasks of getting
# user inputs and calculating the total. Do not define these functions again.
# Without comments, your program should be no longer than 7-8 lines
